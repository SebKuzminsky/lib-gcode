; Better have the spindle running, speed & feed set properly, and cutter
; comp off before calling this function!
;
; This subroutine makes a rectangular pocket by the following process:
;
;     0.  adjust HorizontalDOC and VerticalDOC down to make things work out
;         to even passes
;
;     1.  rapid the cutter to near the starting X Y coordinates, optionally
;         leaving a little material for the finishing pass
;
;     2.  rapid to the retract level Z coordinate
;
;     3.  feed down to the starting Z coordinate, the top of the material 
;
;     Z Loop:
;
;         4.  Feed straight down by the Z Depth Of Cut, but not below the
;             Pocket Bottom Z.
;
;         Horizontal Loop:
;
;             5.  feed to near the final Y coordinate, optionally leaving a
;                 little material for the finishing pass
;
;             6.  if there is more material to remove at this Z level:
;
;                 7.  feed towards the final X coordinate by the Horizontal
;                     Depth Of Cut, but not past the final X coordinate and
;                     optional finish allowance
;
;                 8.  feed to near the starting Y coordinate, optionally
;                     leaving a little material for the finishing pass
;
;             9.  if there is more material to remove at this Z level, feed
;                 towards the final X coordinate by the Horizontal Depth Of
;                 Cut, but not past the final X coordinate and optional
;                 finish allowance
;
;             10. if we're not done yet, repeat the Horizontal Loop
;
;         11. if we're not down to the Pocket Bottom Z yet, repeat the Z Loop
;
;     Optional finishing pass:
;
;         12. If the FinishAllowance argument (arg 10) is greater than
;             zero, do a climbing finish pass around perimeter of the
;             pocket, out to the final dimensions
;
; 13. rapid to the Z retract level
;
;
; Arg 1:  X coordinate of start of pocket
;
; Arg 2:  Y coordinate of start of pocket
;
; Arg 3:  X coordinate of end of pocket
;
; Arg 4:  Y coordinate of end of pocket
;
; Arg 5:  Z coordinate at top of pocket (cutting starts here)
;
; Arg 6:  Z coordinate of bottom of pocket
;
; Arg 7:  Retract level: Z coordinate to rapid to before starting cutting
;         and to retract to when finished pocketing
;
; Arg 8:  Max horizontal depth-of-cut.  On each feed except the first, the
;         cutter will remove no more than this much.
;
; Arg 9:  Max vertical depth-of-cut.
;
; Arg 10: Finish allowance.  This much material will be left during
;         roughing and cleaned up in the finishing pass.  If this is 0, the
;         pocket will be cut to size during the "roughing" passes and no
;         finish pass will be done.
;
; The pocket will be cut *without* cutter comp, so make sure the X and Y
; coordinates take into account the cutter radius.
